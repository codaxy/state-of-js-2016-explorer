# State of JavaScript 2016 Explorer

This is a simple application that visualizes the data collected through 
the [State of JavaScript 2016 survey](http://stateofjs.com/).

The application is built using [the Cx framework](http://cx.codaxy.com), 
which will hopefully lead the charts in the next year's survey. 

## Install & Start
```
npm install
npm start
``` 

## Disclaimer

We did our best and double checked all calculations, however errors are possible.
Please note that we do not take any responsibility for the data displayed through the application.
If you find anything wrong, please report.

## Thanks

A big thank you to [Sacha Greif](https://twitter.com/SachaGreif) for 
conducting the survey and making the data publicly available.
